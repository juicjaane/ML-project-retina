# Vessel Extraction in Retinal Fundus Images 🧠👁️

This project focuses on the extraction of retinal blood vessels from fundus images using traditional image processing techniques. The goal is to enhance the visibility and segmentation of blood vessels without relying on deep learning methods. These techniques are crucial for aiding the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and other retinal diseases.

## 🧾 Project Overview

This work focuses on the **enhancement and segmentation** of blood vessels from colored retinal fundus images. The main tasks include:
- Enhancing the green channel using **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**.
- Applying **matched filtering** for vessel detection.
- Performing **multiscale gradient computation and edge detection** using the **Canny operator**.
- Comparing various image enhancement and filtering techniques using **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and histograms.

## Dataset
The project uses the Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle, which contains:
- High-resolution retinal fundus images
- Binary mask annotations (vessel pixels marked as 1, background as 0)
- Diverse range of retinal pathologies
- Varying vessel widths and branching patterns

## Methodology

### 1. Image Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Color space conversion (RGB to grayscale)
- Noise reduction
- Contrast enhancement

### 2. Image Enhancement Techniques
Various enhancement techniques were implemented and compared:

#### 2.1 Histogram-based Methods
- **Histogram Equalization (HE)**
  ![Histogram Equalization](Images/histogram_eq.png)
  - Improves global contrast
  - May over-enhance some regions

- **Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)**
  ![Adaptive HE](Images/adaptive_he.png)
  - Local contrast enhancement
  - Better preservation of local details

- **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**
  ![CLAHE](Images/clahe.png)
  - Prevents over-amplification of noise
  - Better control over enhancement

#### 2.2 Spatial Domain Methods
- **Gamma Correction**
  ![Gamma Correction](Images/gamma_correction.png)
  - Non-linear transformation
  - Adjusts image brightness

- **Unsharp Masking**
  ![Unsharp Masking](Images/unsharp_masking.png)
  - Edge enhancement
  - Improves vessel visibility

#### 2.3 Frequency Domain Methods
- **Laplacian Filtering**
  ![Laplacian](Images/laplacian_filter.png)
  - Edge detection
  - Second-order derivative

- **Log Transformation**
  ![Log Transform](Images/log_transform.png)
  - Compresses dynamic range
  - Enhances dark regions

- **Exponential Transformation**
  ![Exponential Transform](Images/exp_transform.png)
  - Expands dynamic range
  - Enhances bright regions

### 3. Vessel Detection
Multiple approaches were implemented:

#### 3.1 Matched Filtering
![Matched Filtering](Images/matched_filtering.png)
- Template matching approach
- Detects vessel-like structures

#### 3.2 Laplacian-based Detection
![Laplacian Detection](Images/laplacian_detection.png)
- Second-order derivative
- Edge enhancement

#### 3.3 Non-local Means Filtering
![Non-local Means](Images/non_local_means.png)
- Noise reduction
- Structure preservation

#### 3.4 Adaptive Thresholding
![Adaptive Threshold](Images/adaptive_threshold.png)
- Local threshold computation
- Better handling of varying illumination

### 4. Performance Comparison

## Performance Metrics
The project uses several evaluation metrics:
1. IoU (Intersection over Union)
2. Dice Coefficient
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. Accuracy
6. PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
7. CII (Colorfulness Index Indicator)
8. Entropy

## Results
The final approach combines:
1. CLAHE for contrast enhancement
2. Non-local means filtering for noise reduction
3. Adaptive thresholding for vessel detection

## Future Improvements
1. Implementation of edge linking process
2. Removal of corneal structure artifacts
3. Image preprocessing to handle circumferential artifacts
4. Improved mask positioning for better evaluation metrics
